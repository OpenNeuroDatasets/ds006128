 "TaskName": "Spatio-tactile population receptive field (pRF) mapping.",
 "TaskDescription": "In any given run, participants sensed a row of vibrotactile pins moving along cardinal axes over a portion of the fingertip interspersed with baseline (rest) periods. The pins oscillated according to a sine wave with alternating on and off periods. Participants were required to count brief changes in the frequency of the sine wave during each run."
